Like many of his Italian colleagues at that time, he composed the scores for many exploitation films in the 1960s and 1970s, covering genres such as spaghetti western, Eurospy, Giallo, and soft sex films. Although not as widely regarded as, for example, Ennio Morricone or Riz Ortolani, he helped form the style of the typical European '60s/'70s jazz-influenced film soundtrack that later experienced a revival in films like Kill Bill and Ocean's Twelve.",

Their music crackles with white electricity, a phone line long since gone down. The songs are brief, non-discursive; the vocals are mysterious yowls of a woman abandoning niceties of western culture.

Though he rarely recorded under his own name and left little evidence of his life, Hardy was the major name for Chicago's dance music from the late '70s to the mid-'80s.  While Knuckles was translating disco and the emerging house music to a straight, southside audience at the Power Plant, Hardy's 72-hour mix sessions and flamboyant party lifestyle fit in well with the uptown, mostly gay audience at the Muzic Box. A roll-call of major Chicago producers all debuted their compositions by pressing up acetates or reel-to-reel copies for Hardy to play during the mid-'80s.  Lingering problems with heroin addiction forced him to leave the Muzic Box around 1986 and though he continued to DJ around the area, Hardy wasn't around when Chicago became house music's mecca later in the decade.",

    bio: "Les Rallizes Dénudés (裸のラリーズ, Hadaka no rariizu) were a Japanese rock band formed in 1967 at Kyoto's Doshisha University. They were initially active between 1967 and 1988.  It's thought that the band's name comes from a corruption of French: valises dénudées (literally translating as naked suitcases) which was derived from fake French slang invented with the theatrical group Gendai Gekijo. The band's style is typified by simple, repetitious instrumental passages, shrieking, cacophonous guitar feedback and folk arrangement. Their discography is made up mostly of live bootlegs, soundboard archives, and even a few rare aborted studio recording attempts as they have never officially released any of their material, although there are archive releases on independent labels such as Univive, Rivista, Phoenix, and Bamboo.  In 1970, original bassist Moriaki Wakabayashi assisted in the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351 orchestrated by the Communist League's \"Red Army Faction.\"",

In the wave of rock repression after the Avándaro festival, the group gets closer to its urban roots and Lora and Hauptvogel begin to write songs that reflect the daily life of the people of the Federal District. His outspoken criticism of police brutality and political corruption ensures that his topics do not reach radio or television. However, it achieves immense popularity in Mexico. They commonly performed in places known as \"funky holes\" which were clandestine places where the pioneer groups of Rock in Mexico such as Enigma, Dugs Dugs, Three Souls in my Mind performed their concerts.",

He is further credited as having established congas and bongos, instruments normally central to Latin styles, in Ethiopian music.

As his career evolved, Scott shifted from composing/performing live music to focusing on electronic productions.    In 1946, he established Manhattan Research, a division of Raymond Scott Enterprises.  Relying on several instruments of his invention, Scott recorded futuristic electronic compositions for use in television and radio commercials. Scott developed some of the first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He credited himself as the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer, and is widely considered one of the pioneers of modern electronic music. ",

Wansel eventually signed with Philadelphia International Records as in-house songwriter/producer/arranger. Wansel's music has been used as samples in the world of hip-hop. His 1975 'Theme from The Planets' drum beat intro, is hailed as being one of the first foundation beats of hip-hop.  In 1979 as conductor of the world-famous MFSB Orchestra, Wansel was the music director/conductor for the historic show at the White House commemorating the very first 'Black Music History Month' celebration in 1978.

Their output has been extremely prolific numbering upwards of 50 LPs and nearly three hundred 45s. As their name implies, the music relies on a blend of rhythmic persussive elements. It draws from the French heritage of Benin along with the influence of their anglophone neighbors like Nigeria and Ghana. These influences and rhythmic elements form the backdrop for varied styles they play, a mix ranging from afrobeat, highlife, jazz, soul, rhumba and latin music. Tracks are sung in either French or their native Fon tongue.",

Her ideas brought her home to Japan, then peculating with new notions of what avant-garde and experimental music could be, to form The Mkwaju Ensemble. The project quickly recorded two astounding LPs in 1981 – rhythmic marvels which have become, over the years, among the most celebrated artifacts of 1980’s Japanese music.  With arrangements both profoundly complex and entirely at ease, it is a near perfect image of the sonic optimism which began to blossom at the outset of the 1980’s, drawing on diverse musical traditions – from the explicitly avant-garde, to New Age, and traditional musics from Japan and Africa.",

The Orkestar's musical style, described in their region as Romska Orientalna Musika ('Oriental Gypsy music'), combines a variety of influences: traditional dance music from Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Turkish/Bulgarian rhythms, elements of rumba and salsa, and even Indian film music. True to the multicultural, multilingual nature of the Balkans, it contains lyrics in Macedonian (Slavic), in Romani (a Gypsy language, related to Hindi), and in a Turkish dialect spoken by the Gypsy community of Kočani.",

The California surf rock craze is in full-swing, so they begin learning the signature surf tunes. A demo is recorded in November 1969 at Allegro Sound Studios in NYC. Pressing the tapes onto 50 vinyl copies, band attorney George Seaton uses the demo to land a major record deal with Polydor. However, the band soon breaks up without releasing an album.    Years later, with the demo and band long forgotten, the Little Indians label acquired an original demo copy and created an unofficial 1997 reissue, leading to a resurgence of interest in this band that almost never was.",
