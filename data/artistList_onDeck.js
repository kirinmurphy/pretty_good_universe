    bio: "Music lovers will be astonished at the influence The Wrecking Crew wielded over rock and pop music in the 1960s and early 1970s. These unsung instrumentalists were the de-facto backing band on hit records by The Beach Boys, Phil Spector, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Elvis, The Monkees and many more. These dedicated musicians brought the flair and musicianship that made the American “West Coast Sound” a dominant cultural force around the world.",

    bio: "In 1983, Rick James proposed to Motown Records that his backing vocalists Joanne \"Jojo\" McDuffie be offered a solo career, but miscommunication caused the label to sign an all-female group, which he determined would be the Mary Jane Girls.  James filled the positions behind McDuffie with Cheri Wells, Candice \"Candi\" Ghant and Kimberly \"Maxi\" Wuletich. He also wrote all the original songs and produced all the recordings. On the band, James said \"I wanted there to be a Black female group in the industry that could express more reality with relationships to men. I wanted there to be Black girls who could really speak about love, the pain, money, power, hate and everything. Originally there were going to be three girls in negligees doing the punk thing.\"",
